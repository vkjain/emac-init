* GIT Notes
git init hello 
 - to create a directory by name "hello" and make it git trackable
 - > cd hello  ;; change directory
 - > tree .git ;; you will see the objects directory
Test by touch README  ;; empty file README
> git add README
> git commit -m"initial"
- Post this you can run the below command after entering the objects directory
  > for i in $(find . -type f | tr -d [/.]); do printf "$i\t"; git cat-file -t $i; done

 - git cat-file -p <give enough SHA1 digits> 
   - to get to know the property of file we are looking at in git objects dir
 - git cat-file -t <give enough SHA1 digits>
   - to get to know the type of file we are looking at in git objects dir
   -
* Note that git generated SHA1s are to do with content and not the filename.
* Cloning a git managed repository to another local directory
 - > cd /tmp
 - > git clone --bare ~/hello ;; remember hello was our git managed dir
 - > cd hello.git
 - > tree . ;; you should see the exact same thing as the structure of hello dir
 - > diff -r ~/hello/.git . ;; diff our hello.git dir with ~/hello dir
* one more way to do it
 - this time rm -rf ~/hello directory
 - now we will clone our repository /tmp/hello.git as if it was remote
 - > git clone ssh://localhost/tmp/hello.git
 - it will come out with an error as we do not have a public/private keypair
 - > ssh-keygen ;; we will generate one
 - > cd .ssh
 - you need to add the id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys file by
 - > cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys

* fourth video
 - > git clone git@github.com:jsh/hello.git
